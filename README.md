## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental components in computer science and software development. They enable efficient organization, retrieval, and manipulation of data. This repository aims to provide well-documented C implementations of various data structures to aid developers in their projects.

## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**: A basic singly-linked list implementation.
2. **Stack**: An implementation of a stack data structure.
3. **Queue**: An implementation of a queue data structure.
4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary search tree for efficient searching and sorting.
5. **Hash Table**: A simple hash table implementation.
6. **Graph**: A basic representation of a graph with common graph operations.

Each data structure is located in its own directory within the repository, containing the C source code along with example usage.

## Usage

To use any of the data structures in your C project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-structures-using-c.git
